This project of verifying a FIFO design using system Verilog includes:

  1) Interface Creation: Develop an interface that uses a clocking block to handle the clock signal for synchronous operations, ensuring proper sampling of input signals and driving of output signals.
  
  2) Input Randomization: Randomize the input data for the FIFO according to the following 
  constraints:
          a. The first 8 bits of the input data (data_in) should fall within the range [100:230].
          b. The second 8 bits of the input data should fall within the range [200:255].
          c. The third 8 bits of the input data should be generated with the following probabilities:
          d. Range [0:100] with a probability of 30%.
          e. Range [100:200] with a probability of 60%.
          f. Range [200:255] with a probability of 10%.
          g. The last 8 bits of the input data should fall within the range [0:50] if the first 8 bits are greater than 150; otherwise, they should fall within the range [0:255].
          h. Randomize the Read_enable and Write_enable signals with appropriate weights of your choice.
     
  4) Coverage Points: Implement cover points to ensure 100% coverage of the Full Flag and Empty Flag signals.
  5) Assertions1: Write an assertion to verify the following condition: When the Write_enable signal is asserted and the FIFO is not full, the write pointer  (write_ptr) should increment.
  6)  Assertion 2:Write any additional assertion that you consider important for verifying the correctness or functionality of the FIFO design
  7)  Code Coverage: Perform code coverage analysis to assess the effectiveness of the testbench in exercising the RTL code
